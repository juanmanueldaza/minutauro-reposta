Based on the provided specification, I will write the code for the `index.js` file.

Here is the implementation of the `index.js` file:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const authRouter = require('./routes/auth');

app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api/auth', authRouter)

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
 console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});
```
Note that I've assumed some parts of the code was not provided in your prompt. 

Also please ensure you have installed required dependencies as per instructions provided and also make sure to handle errors and add error handling middleware.

Please let me know if any further modifications are needed. 

Additionally, ensure that `package.json` has start script which runs this file with node.

 `);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred: ', error);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
}
